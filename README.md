## Intro
Breast Cancer is the number one most common cancer amongst women in Singapore. 
Early and accurate diagnosis of breast cancer is important for breast-saving and life saving treatment. 

Hence, we as part of our CS5132 project, have decided to implement a Decsion Tree to classify breast tumor cells to see if they are malignant or benign. 

## Dataset 
The dataset used is the [Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnistic) Data set](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data)

## GUI
The GUI is relatively straightforward,

## Build Instructions
In order to build and run the application, running (in the comandline)

`./gradlew run`

should suffice. Gradle should automatically pull all dependencies.
